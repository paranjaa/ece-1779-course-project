Team #26 developed Ticker, a distributed inventory tracking system. Ticker is designed for businesses that require accurate, real time tracking of stock levels. Ticker uses a Python backend, and PostgreSQL with persistent volumes for user and inventory data. The system makes use of role-based access control to handle inventory access for different users. Each component is containerized using Docker, and deployed using Docker Swarm on multiple DigitalOcean droplets. Finally, Ticker makes use of Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and displaying system health. Our goal is to improve operational efficiency by providing a reliable alternative to manual inventory management.
